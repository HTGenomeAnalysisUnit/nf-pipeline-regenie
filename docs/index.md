# nf-pipeline-regenie

A nextflow pipeline to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and rare variant association analysis using [regenie](https://github.com/rgcgithub/regenie) at high speed.

## Main features:

- The pipeline is optimized for massive scaling, by chunking operations as much as possible. When computational resources are available, you can cut down run time by increasing the limit on concurrent tasks (see the [adjust parallelization section](parallelization.md)).
- All major data types are accepted as input, including plink1 binary dataset (bed/bim/fam), plink2 binary dataset (pgen/pvar/psam), bgen format (bgen/bgi/sample), and vcf.gz format.
- The pipeline can perform both standard GWAS analysis on single variants, and aggregated rare variant tests using burden test and any of the tests available in regenie, namely skat, skato, sakto-acat, acatv, acato, acato-full.
- Results include summary statistics, but also filtered tophits / loci annotated with nearby genes and an HTML report for each phenotype with Manhattan plot and regional plots for the best loci.
- Two running modes are available: [**single project mode**](single-model.md) and [**multi models mode**](multi-models.md). Using the multi models mode it is possible fully automate the test of multiple association models for a cohort. You just need to provide a trait table with phenotype and covariates and a model table containing all the desired combinations of models. The pipeline will take care of settin up uniform analysis groups.

## How to use

The suggested way to run the pipeline is to create a config file defining your computations environment (see the [hpc profile section](hpc-profile.md)) and a config file for your project (see the [main parameters section](main-parameters.md)). You can use the templates provided in the `templates` folder.

Then you can invoke the pipeline using `nextflow run HTGenomeAnalysisUnit/nf-pipeline-regenie -profile singularity,myprofile -c your_project.conf -c your_profile.conf`

See the [quick start section](quick-start.md) for a minimal example.
